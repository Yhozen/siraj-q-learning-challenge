# Siraj Q learning Challenge

## Description


Adding moving walls will make it a lot harder for the bot but it will learn in a reasonable time so it's still funny to see 


## Usage

Just run `python Learner.py`, also you can set the number of walls in the arguments and grid size (e.g: `python Learner.py 10` for 10 walls, `python Learner.py 10 10` for 10 walls and 10x10 grid)
